# Playwright B2B Data Scraper Pipeline

A robust, asynchronous web scraping pipeline built with Python, Playwright, and BeautifulSoup4. This system mimics human browsing behavior to bypass basic bot-detection mechanisms, extracts structured data fields dynamically, and exports the data into clean CSV formats ready for downstream processing or machine learning pipelines.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

* **Runtime Environment:** Python 3.10+
* **Browser Automation:** Playwright (Chromium Engine)
* **HTML Parsing Engine:** BeautifulSoup4
* **Data Serialization:** Pandas
* **Security Evading:** Fake-UserAgent (Dynamic Header Rotation)

The scraper utilizes an asynchronous architecture to efficiently handle network latency. By launching a headless browser instance, it fully renders JavaScript-heavy applications before extracting the underlying page source.
